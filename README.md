# Critical Mass - 2021 Internship

## Work / Project Examples

1. Ecommerce Storefront prototype
    - One of my previous works involved me working as a web developer with an independent veterinary clinc in setting an online storefront for their business to accommodate for the changes in practice due to COVID-19. My role was to go through the entire process of software development such as gathering requirements, research and technical writing, and finally implementing a software solution that best suits the client (veterinary clinc).

2. UI design/figma projects
    - To develop my developer skills even more, I decide to focus on a skill set that lacked a lot in and that was user interface design. During the time of my Winter 2020 semester, I decided to take a course in UI design which focus very heavily on design principles and human behaviours as to why certain mainstream websites are designed to look certain ways. The work heavily revolves around using sketching, prototyping, and using Figma following principles to create better looking and function interfaces for both desktop and mobile screens.

3. Game programming course
    - One of the most fun and interesting course I took as an elective was Game Programming. Using a set library involving C and OpenGL, we were to focus on how some game engines work and function when given certain tasks from some game features. These features includes ways of terrain generation, npc AI, and player movement/detection. I was tasked to implement many these features into the given game engine and slowly build up a "rouge" like game during the time of the course.

## Inspiration

1. One work that has recently inspired me was a free and open source app called "Tachiyomi". "Tachiyomi" is an android app that lets users read comics and such using multiple sources on the internet while allowing the user customize features to their needs. What I found the most inspiring about "Tachiyomi" was that it was started by the community of comic/mangas readers due to there not having an option to read while being on a mobile device. Following that, sources used to read comics and such are created by the community from web scraping and then formating the information onto the mobile format. The app today recieves frequent updates that aims to improve usuability.

2. Another work that inspired me was another free and open source app called "Youtube Vanced". "Youtube Vanced" is an android app that function essientally like Youtube Premium but without the need to pay. "Youtube Vanced" brings the same features such as no ads, on the go video playing, and music that Youtube Premium offers but for free to android users. What is most inspiring to me about this app is that someone solved the most frustrating issues with the normal Youtube app but creating a tech alternative while keeping it free and available to android users. The saying "create something to solve a problem" is truly defined here by most of the apps I have mentioned.

## Focus

- If I were given time and resources to build/learn anything I wanted during my internship, I would choose to learn the tech stack that is used at Critical Mass or any other modern day tech stack. I want to understand how companies use their tech stacks efficicently and apply them to their needs of creating a product/service that is used by people around the world.
